This relies on a protocol called DHCP that automatically provides an IP address and other access data to your router. We have not (yet) implemented this service so you need to manually configure this data. Most routers allow this configuration under a menu entry called \"WAN\" or \"Internet\". If this is not the case for your router model, please consult the manual."
